# FireBase CRUD Operation

Firebase is a cloud-based platform that provides a variety of tools and services for building mobile and web applications. One common use case for Firebase is to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database.

A Firebase CRUD operation app typically allows users to interact with a database using a graphical user interface. Users can create new records, view existing records, update existing records, and delete records. These operations can be performed on a variety of data types, including text, numbers, and images.
